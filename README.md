# Fullstackopen - Exercise part 5
By Nguyen Hoang Hai
"This repository is missing parts 5.1-5.4 because I forgot to commit and push the code to GitHub, and I moved on to complete exercises from parts 5.5 - 5.11 instead."

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
